            >(3) To enable you to "checklist" jobs that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing.</p>
            <p>Advertising networks that serve jobs onto the PREMIVAL.com career website may also use their own cookies. PREMIVAL will also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by PREMIVAL. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access items and referring website addresses.</p>
            <h3>How your information is used?</h3>
            <p>By submitting your information, You agree that PREMIVAL, its affiliates, subsidiaries and other related entities under DESOL Company may use your information we gather whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving the PREMIVAL website, fostering a positive user experience or introducing and delivering the products and services that we or they offer.</p>
            <p>We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications regarding updates at the PREMIVAL website and our Services and Products. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you. In addition, at the time of registration, you have the option to elect to receive additional communications, information and promotions including without limitation free informational newsletters from PREMIVAL relating to topics that may be of special interest to you.</p>
            <p>We have an area where you can contact us. Any feedback you send to us becomes our property, and we can use such feedback (such as success stories) for marketing purposes or contact you for further information.</p>
            <h3>Who is collecting your information?</h3>
            <p>When you are asked for personal information on the PREMIVAL Website, you are sharing that information with the PREMIVAL Website alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However, some activities will, by their very nature, result in your personal information being revealed to other users of the PREMIVAL Website. For example, when you enter personal information on the job posting form, this information will generally be included in your job, unless specifically stated otherwise</p>
            <h3>With whom your information may be shared</h3>
            <p>We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of the PREMIVAL Website (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth in the following five subparagraphs.</p>
            <p>1. We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for a PREMIVAL Website account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, candidates, job seekers, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the products or services of a particular third-party.</p>
            <p>2. We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card or other types of payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.</p>
            <p>3. We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Management Consulting Group, Ltd. or its partner companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>
            <p>4. We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of Management Consulting Group, Ltd.'s business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Management Consulting Group, Ltd. becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Management Consulting Group, Ltd. or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.</p>
            <p>5. We may use your name, your company's name or logo, or any other information about or from your job postings or resume viewing account for any PREMIVAL Website's marketing purposes. For example, company names or logos may be used in newspaper advertising, direct mail pieces, sales kits, posters and other materials related to PREMIVAL Website.</p>
            <p>Management Consulting Group, Ltd. may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to each of its Web sites (for example, the number of visitors to PREMIVAL Website's 'Search Jobs' section) with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors to the PREMIVAL Website website and how those visitors use the site.</p>
            <p>Management Consulting Group, Ltd. may supply technology, hosting and related services to other leading companies to power recruitment areas on their websites (sometimes referred to as "private label recruitment areas"). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you in private label recruitment areas becomes part of the PREMIVAL Website database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you, Management Consulting Group, Ltd. and the company concerned without your consent.</p>
            <p>Information gathered on a page in a private label recruitment area, or on a co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by PREMIVAL Website and another company), may become the property of the other company or of both Management Consulting Group, Ltd. and the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other company may be subject to the privacy policy of that company and, in any event, Management Consulting Group, Ltd. is not responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic information.</p>
            <h3>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information</h3>
            <p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you will not be able to use most of the PREMIVAL Website career website. You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those services of the PREMIVAL Website recruiting website that require registration in order to participate. These services include the identification of new jobs that have been posted since your last visit, auto-fillin of the logon form, and the Checklist feature. You can still use most of the features of the PREMIVAL Website recruiting website even if you do not accept cookies.</p>
            <h3>How you can access, update or delete your information</h3>
            <p>We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the "CIP Profile" link or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in.

            <p>If you are a previously registered user and you have lost or forgotten your password, you may obtain it by email by using our "Forgot Password" feature. Click the button on any login page to request that your password be emailed to you. We cannot provide your password by any other means. Your PREMIVAL Website recruiting website account can be deleted, but doing so will result in not being able to access any of the features of the program that require user registration.

            <h3>The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information</h3>
            <p>Other than the administrator of the PREMIVAL Website recruiting website or other authorized personnel of PREMIVAL Website, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. PREMIVAL Website will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in the PREMIVAL Website recruiting website. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, PREMIVAL Website cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
            <h3>How PREMIVAL Website protects children's privacy</h3>
            <p>PREMIVAL Website is a general audience web site. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. PREMIVAL Website does not share personal information about users who indicate they are under the age of 13 with third parties. In addition, PREMIVAL Website will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.</p>
            <h3>What else you should know about your online privacy</h3>
            <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example in jobs that you post or through email - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>
